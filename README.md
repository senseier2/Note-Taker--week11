## User Story
    AS A small business owner
    I WANT to be able to write and save notes
    SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a note-taking application
    WHEN I open the Note Taker
    THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
    WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
    THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
    THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
    WHEN I click on the Save icon
    THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
    WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
    THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
    WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
    THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

## Usage
    - Click the "Get Started" button on the landing page to access the application. 
    - Then click the "+" button to start a new note. Each note has a Note Title field and a content area for your notes.  
    - When your note is completed,  click the save button to store the note for later retrieval via the side bar.

    - You can also delete unneeded notes via the trash can icon in the side bar next to the corresponding notes.
